# 2P Fighting Game in Sprig
This was a short Javascript project made in Hack Club's Sprig Editor, and inspired by old rock'em sock'em toys and fighting games.  
Play with 2 players! Move with `A` and `D` (P1), or `J` and `L` (P2)! Punch with `W` (P1) or `I` (P2)!  
Launch a hadouken with `S` (P1) or `K` (P2)! See a hadouken coming your way? Deflect it with `W` (P1) or `I` (P2)!  
Want to play? Go to this [Sprig link](https://sprig.hackclub.com/share/zulG5fhlKKfyBdcIBR5m) and knock your friends out! ðŸ¤œðŸ‘Š (figuratively, of course)
